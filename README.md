# üíª First Method: Crosh >_

Open the Crosh shell: Press Control + Alt + T on your Chromebook keyboard. Crosh is described as similar to a Command Prompt (CMD) for Chromebooks.

View running processes: Type top to see the processes running on the network.

In a school setting, this should display other connected computers.

Access advanced help options: Open a new tab and type help_advanced. This will display a list of advanced commands related to the Wi-Fi connection.
Last, disconnect the network: Typing either disconnect_ethernet or disconnect_lan will shut down the Wi-Fi network.

A well-documented and patched ChromeOS exploit example is the **Chromebook Pico Ducky ‚ÄúBreakout‚Äù exploit**, which demonstrated how ChromeOS could be manipulated to escape restricted environments through physical input device injection‚ÄØ. Here are the general steps of this now-mitigated exploit for educational and research context:[1]

# EXTRA EXPLOIT

### Overview
The exploit took advantage of a vulnerability in the **Crosh terminal** command handling system. It used a **USB-based Human Interface Device (HID)** (commonly a Raspberry‚ÄØPi‚ÄØPico configured as a ‚ÄúRubber‚ÄØDucky‚Äù) to simulate rapid keyboard input sequences that unlocked developer commands in otherwise restricted environments‚ÄØ.[1]

### Stages of the Exploit

1. **Preparation**  
   The attacker configured a USB microcontroller (e.g., Pico or BadUSB) to emulate a keyboard and programmed it with a payload consisting of Crosh commands‚ÄØ.[1]

2. **Triggering Crosh**  
   When the device was plugged into the Chromebook, it automatically invoked **Crosh** (using the keyboard shortcut‚ÄØCtrl‚ÄØ+‚ÄØAlt‚ÄØ+‚ÄØT) and typed sequences to open hidden developer options‚ÄØ.[1]

3. **Command Injection**  
   The HID script quickly executed debug or networking commands (like `shell`, `shill`, or `set_cellular_ppp`) that were normally restricted. Older ChromeOS builds did not properly verify privilege contexts, allowing partial shell access‚ÄØ.[1]

4. **Privilege Escalation Attempt**  
   By exploiting flawed input validation in the Crosh parser, the attacker could manipulate command responses that granted access to deeper system layers‚Äîessentially bypassing some managed restrictions‚ÄØ.[1]

5. **Payload Execution / Persistence (Post‚ÄëExploit)**  
   Once Crosh accepted these commands, arbitrary diagnostics were run, and additional command sequences established limited file system access, enabling ‚Äúescape‚Äù from kiosk‚Äëmode or managed session restrictions.  

### Aftermath
Google patched this method in later ChromeOS releases by:
- Implementing stricter HID event sanitation;  
- Requiring authentication checks for Crosh commands;  
- Completely isolating user‚Äëaccessible terminals from privileged subsystems‚ÄØ.[2]

This exploit no longer functions on up‚Äëto‚Äëdate systems but remains a notable example of how **hardware‚Äëassisted command injection** can reveal design weaknesses in Crosh‚Äôs sandboxxing.
